# Titanic-Passengers-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.


IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Languages Used: Python
Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Machine Learning Algorithms


Dataset Description:

      PassengerId: unique id number to each passenger
      
      Survived   : passenger survive(1) or died(0)

      Pclass     : passenger class
      
      Name       : name
      
      Sex        : gender

      Age        : age
      
      SibSp      : Number of siblings/spouses
      
      Parch      : Number of parent/child
      
      Ticket     : ticket number
      
      Fare       : amount of money spend to ticket($)
      
      Cabin      : cabin category
      
      Embarked   : port where passenger embark (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)


Steps Involved:----

  -> Importing Libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

  
  -> Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
  
  -> Data Visualization
  
  -> Data Preprocessing
  
      - Finding Null Values
      
      - Handling the missing values
      
      - Dropping unnecessary columns
      
      - Label Encoding(converting categorical columns into numerical)
 
  -> Splitting data into training and testing
  
  -> Model Training(Train a machine learning model)
  
  -> predict based on the test set.
  
  -> Model Evaluation and Accuracy Score( Evaluate the accuracy of the model)
